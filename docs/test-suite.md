## Testing

To run the tests:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --features all
```

We recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing. With nextest installed, simply substitute `cargo test` with `cargo nextest run`.

## Running integration tests

The test suite is a collection of integration tests designed to setup the full e2e stack and test various scenarios.
Take a look at the `src/suite/consensus/mod.rs` file to see the different tests that are available.

### Dependencies

Ensure you have bitcoind and cometbft in your PATH.
You can either install these binaries or make them from scratch.
To run the integration tests suite:

```sh
make start-test-suite
```

Note: the test suite will not build the btc server or reth binaries for you. It simply uses the binaries that are in /target/debug.
So before running the test suite, you need to build the binaries.

```bash
cargo build && cd bin/btc-server && cargo build --bin btc-server
```

However, integration tests can ONLY be run using the local bitcoind instance with `regtest`. Running them on the `signet` is not feasible as block times are quite long there and the test will not finish in time. You are advised, prior to running the integration tests suite to update the `.env` file with your paths:

```bash
NODE_1_DIR=[your node 1 directory path]
NODE_2_DIR=[your node 2 directory path]
JWT_DIR=[your jwt directory path]

BITCOIND_NETWORK=[BTC NETWORK e.g. regtest]
BITCOIND_URL=[BITCOIND PROTOCOL URL WITH PORT e.g. http://localhost:18443 for regtest]
BITCOIND_USER=[USERNAME]
BITCOIND_PWD=[PASSWORD]
```
