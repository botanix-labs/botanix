# Local Setup Guide

## Requirements

To develop and run this project locally, ensure you have the following tools installed.

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Binaries folder contains binary of `cometbft` & `bticoind`
3. We can find `local_setup.sh` inside the project root, which contains commands for init, start and stop the services and nodes.

## Project Execution Steps

1.  Download binaraires `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-cli`, `bitcoin-wallet` & `cometbft` to your home directory & set

    ```
    DEFAULT_BINARY_PATH="{PROVIDE_BINARIES_PATH}  //Set downloaded binary path in `local_setup.sh`
    ```

2.  use below command which initialize the folders, in your home directory.

    ```
    ./local_setup.sh init
    ```

**Note:** The `init` command will create a `temp` directory, and within that directory, it will generate subdirectories for Bitcoin nodes, POA nodes, and CometBFT nodes.

3.  Create a file named federation.toml and copy the contents of the [Federational.Toml](https://github.com/botanix-labs/Macbeth/blob/cf1d3272ace7df42e016b4dcb98bcbf1fcfd9add/book/installation/chain-config.md?plain=1#L4) file and save it node1 and node2 folders. Which contains federation members keys.

4.  Update the comet BFT config files, which will be created inside the comet folders.

|                                                  |

4.  Use below command to `start` a `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-server`,`POA` and `cometbft`nodes.

    ```
    ./local_setup.sh start
    ```

5.  Use script below command to `stop` services and nodes.

    ```
    ./local_setup.sh stop
    ```

6.  Use script below command to `clean` services and nodes.

    ```
    ./local_setup.sh clean
    ```

**Note:** clean command will delete the tmp folders and contents.
