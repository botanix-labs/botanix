//! # Database Table Definitions
//!
//! This module defines all the database tables used by the Botanix storage system.
//! Each table represents a specific data domain and defines the key-value mapping
//! for efficient storage and retrieval.
//!
//! ## Table Overview
//!
//! The Botanix storage system uses the following tables:
//!
//! ### Snapshot Tables
//! - [`Snapshots`]: Maps snapshot IDs to snapshot metadata
//! - [`Chunks`]: Maps chunk IDs to individual chunk data
//! - [`BlockSnapshots`]: Maps block numbers to snapshot IDs
//! - [`ChunkBlocks`]: Maps chunk IDs to their block numbers
//! - [`SnapshotSyncs`]: Tracks snapshot synchronization progress
//!
//! ### Header Tables
//! - [`StagedHeader`]: Maps block hashes to headers with pegin/pegout data
//!
//! ### Wallet Sync Tables
//! - [`WalletStateSyncs`]: Maps peer IDs to wallet state sync records
//!
//! ## Usage with Reth
//!
//! These tables integrate with the Reth database infrastructure, providing
//! type-safe access to the underlying MDBX database with automatic serialization
//! and deserialization of complex data structures.
