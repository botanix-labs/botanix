    /// Performs a single step in a range-based pruning operation, processing one entry
    /// from the walker. This method is designed for fine-grained control over pruning
    /// operations, particularly when coordinating pruning across multiple tables.
    ///
    /// # Type Parameters
    ///
    /// * `T` - The table type being pruned
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// * `walker` - A mutable reference to the range walker that iterates through table entries
    /// * `limiter` - Pruning limiter for tracking deleted entries (used for callback only)
    /// * `skip_filter` - Function that returns true for rows that should be skipped
    /// * `delete_callback` - Function called for each deleted row
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(true)` - If the walker has no more entries to process (finished)
    /// * `Ok(false)` - If the walker has more entries that could be processed
    /// * `Err(DatabaseError)` - If there was a database access error
