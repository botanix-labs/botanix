/// This trait provides read-only access to blockchain snapshots, chunks, and
/// synchronization state. Snapshots represent point-in-time states of the
/// blockchain that can be used for fast synchronization and historical queries.
///
/// ## Snapshot Architecture
///
/// - **Snapshots**: Metadata about blockchain state at specific heights
/// - **Chunks**: Segmented data within snapshots for efficient storage/transmission
/// - **Sync State**: Progress tracking for snapshot synchronization operations
