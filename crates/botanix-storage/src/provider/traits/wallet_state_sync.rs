/// Trait for reading wallet state synchronization data from the database.
///
/// This trait provides read-only access to wallet state synchronization records,
/// which coordinate the synchronization of wallet states across network peers.
/// The wallet state sync system ensures that all peers maintain consistent
/// wallet information for proper Bitcoin pegin/pegout operations.
///
/// ## Synchronization Model
///
/// - **Peer-based**: Each peer maintains its own synchronization record
/// - **Chunked Data**: Wallet state is synchronized in chunks for efficiency
/// - **Superset Logic**: Minimum supersets are calculated for consensus
