//! # Data Models
//!
//! This module contains all the core data structures used by the Botanix storage system.
//! These models represent the persistent data entities that are stored in the database
//! and exchanged between network peers.
//!
//! ## Module Organization
//!
//! - **activation_manager**: Network upgrade voting and version management models
//! - **snapshot**: Blockchain snapshot and chunk data structures
//! - **staged_header**: Headers with associated pegin/pegout transaction data
//! - **wallet_sync**: Wallet state synchronization coordination models
//!
//! All models implement the necessary traits for:
//! - Serialization/deserialization with `serde`
//! - Compact encoding for efficient storage with `reth-codecs`
//! - Arbitrary instance generation for testing (when enabled)
//!
//! ## Database Compression
//!
//! The models are configured with database compression support through the
//! `impl_compression_for_compact!` macro, which provides efficient storage
//! by leveraging the Reth compact encoding system.
