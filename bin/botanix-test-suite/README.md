# Integration Test Suite

Botanix's test-suite

### Setup

Integration tests require that bitcoind is setup in regtest mode. The tests will not setup bitcoind for you. You need to do this step first.
After you setup bitcoind in regtest create your `.env` file at the root with your paths and bitcoind values.
Use `template.env` as an example.

Additionally ensure you don't have any reth or btc servers running on the default ports.

### To run all tests

run from the main dir `make start-test-suite`
